## Wildfires, Floods, and More Earthquakes in This Solar Cycle

It may come as a bit of a surprise for some people, that floods due to cyclones will occur in desert areas like Dubai of UAE, and Rajasthan of India, by June-July of 2025. However, for scientists studying ocean and sea temperatures of the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea, it will be much less of a surprise and more of a sign that climate change is accelerating. 

Prior to those floods, wildfires and brush fires will sweep large swaths of lands in various parts of the planet, in April-May of 2025. Again, for many climate scientists and geologists, this wouldn't be much of a surprise. 

The much more difficult thing to predict are earthquakes. Earthquakes aren't related to oceanic or atmospheric rise in temperatures, obviously, but the current century of our Anthropocene era is simply a tiny part of a 9,000 (nine thousand) year cycle of geological activity in the earth's crust. That geological activity is increasing towards a peak that shall result in more earthquakes and volcanic eruptions along the tectonic plates constituting the "Ring of Fire."  

Right about now, sun spots should have started to form in the sun, and the earth's magnetic dipole moment and "wobble" during its translation around the sun, should have started to accelerate. That minute acceleration won't matter to humans as we can't feel it on earth. Its effects will be more acutely measurable from space satellites when coronal mass ejections from the sun reach the earth, and charged particles swirl towards latitudes lower than the Arctic Circle, closer towards the Tropic of Cancer, to create atmospheric phenomena like the Aurora. The changing trajectory of those solar particles over a period of months, will be measurable by a few projects being conducted by the American, European, and Japanese space agencies. 

The upcoming solar storms of this year, will create some problems and issues for aviation and space telecommunications for a few weeks at a time, during the months of June-October of 2025.  

The things on earth that benefit from large showers of solar particles and wildfires, includes pine tree seeds (from pine cones), and seeds of the plant called [Abrus Precatorius.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrus_precatorius) Those seeds are initially thirsty for fire, instead of water, and they welcome raging wildfires, in order to germinate, and be able to subsequently spread life, upon a scorched earth.

When wildfires occur around eucalyptus trees, the flames can become towering infernos because of the oils and cyclical hydrocarbons from the eucalyptus bark and leaves. Eucalyptus trees are the most thirsty for water, among plants and animals on earth, but with a depleted water table and severe drought conditions, the leaves and bark of the tree become dry fuel laden with volatile resin, for accelerating impending brush fires.
